# Computerlexikon

This is my website written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It is a school project that I made in ~2 weeks.

If you want a little documentation on it, feel free to read it. It is located in the documentation directory. Just be aware that it is in German, so if you can't read that, get your translator ready!
